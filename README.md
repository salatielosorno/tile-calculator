# Tile Calculator App

While I was making some changes in my home I found that calculate how many box of tile you need to cover a ground is a repetitive task which can be improve using the technology and it is a good oportunity to test my knowledge about React.

I think this app can growing so much but for now I provide a basic functionality which can be useful for you to save time.

If you found this app useful tell me about it. I will be glad to hear you.
